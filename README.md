# Custom Mailfilter for Uberspace 7

> Attention: This mailfilter is intended to work for Uberspace 7 â€“ a setup for Uberspace 6 with DSPAM and SpamAssassin can be found [here](https://github.com/stratmaster/uberspace-tools).

---

This script can be used for setting up a customized mailfilter config with **Rspamd** and **Bogofilter** on an [Uberspace 7](https://uberspace.de) server. Every message will be filtered by these two services: Learning false positives or false negatives is realized with Bogofilter, while Rspamd uses multiple filtering and statistical methods to generate a spam score (which is later used for filtering). [Custom rules](https://wiki.uberspace.de/mail:maildrop#sonstige_filtereien) can be added too. If messages are not correctly recognized as ham, they can be manually taught as ham by setting up a Keeplist (one email address each line).

> At this time Rspamd isn't configurable for learning on userlevel (see [manual](https://manual.uberspace.de/mail-spam.html) for the actual default behavior). According to Uberspace this might change in the future...

The main goal of this filter is a more intuitive workflow with less special folders (like `Learn as Spam` and `Learn as Ham`) when showing messages to Bogofilter via a customized `spam-learn` script so it can learn. This is realized by marking messages, recognized or reclassified as spam, with the header `X-Spam-Folder: YES`, which is removed for messages that are reclassified as ham. All reclassified messages will be re-delivered via `maildrop`. Finally, teaching spam or ham works like this:

> * When moving a message *from* 'Junk | Spam | Junk-E-Mail' *to* 'Inbox' it will be learned by Bogofilter as Ham
> * When moving a message *from* 'Inbox' *to* 'Junk | Spam | Junk-E-Mail' it will be learned by Bogofilter as Spam

*Please Note*: Only messages of the last 24 hours are interpreted by `spam-learn` to prevent slow scanning due to big folders.

# Installation of Bogofilter

Get [Bogofilter](https://www.bogofilter.org/) and install it like this:

```bash
  wget -O bogofilter.tar.xz https://sourceforge.net/projects/bogofilter/files/bogofilter-stable/bogofilter-1.2.5.tar.xz/download
  tar -xvf bogofilter.tar.xz
  cd bogofilter-1.2.5
  ./configure --with-database=sqlite3 --prefix=$HOME
  make
  make install
```
(Please adapt to current bogofilter version in the future)

# Installation of Mailfilter
### Core Files
* Set up `.qmail` and `maildrop` before (see [.qmail](http://www.lifewithqmail.org/lwq.html) and [maildrop](http://www.courier-mta.org/maildrop/) documentation for setting up)
* Rename `.mailfilter` to `.mailfilter-EXT` (replace `EXT` by your namespace) before.
* Put the file `.mailfilter` (or `.mailfilter-EXT`) and the folder `.mailfilters` in the home directory of your uberspace.
* Remember to set the correct file permissions: `chmod 600 ~/.mailfilter` (or `.mailfilter-EXT`)
* mailfilter(-EXT) logfiles can be found in `~/logs` 
* `spam-learn` goes to `~/bin` (its database will later be found in `~/.bogofilter`)
* Remember to set the correct file permissions: `chmod 755 ~/bin/spam-learn`

### Adding `spam-learn` as a cronjob

Add `spam-learn` as a cronjob that is running once per hour:

Call crontab

```bash
  crontab -e
```

and add this lines

```bash
  # Call spam-learn hourly
  @hourly ~/bin/spam-learn
```
